I know this might seem odd… “You allow people to DM you openly, but you still have this rule?”

**YES!** Let me explain.

It happens *so often* where someone sends me just a “Hello!” or “Are you there?” and then… silence for hours! 😫 So, to make things easier for both of us, here are a few quick guidelines:

You can DM me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1248626823638552701) or [Twitter](https://x.com/stellerDev).

### Please **🚫DO NOT🚫** send messages like:
- “Hello, are you around?” <Just that>
- “Hi Stella, quick question…” <And nothing else>
- “You got a sec?” <Without any details>
- "Hey" <With nothing to follow up>
- "Can I ask you something?" <Please, just ask it!>

### **Instead, do this:**
- Jump straight to the point! I appreciate direct questions like:
  - “Hey Stella, I was wondering how to set up X in my project. Do you have any advice?”
  - “Quick question: How do you handle Y situation? I’ve been struggling with this.”
  - “I need help with Z. Here’s the issue…”
  
That way, I can help you faster, and we avoid the back-and-forth of "are you there?" 🙌

### Things that will make me *super happy*:
- If you respect my time and get to the point.
- If you give me enough info upfront so I can actually help.
- If you don't leave me hanging for hours after I respond!

### Other Tips:
- Be mindful of the time! I might not always reply immediately.
- If it’s something that can be easily found by Googling, please try that first.
