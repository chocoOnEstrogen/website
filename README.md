## Development

To run the website locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

Edit the [`config.ts`](./config.ts) file to add your personal information. Then, run the following command:

```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
