# Arch Linux Installation Scripts

## Installation

```bash
curl -L https://www.choco.rip/scripts/ArchLinux/setup.sh --output setup.sh
chmod a+x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

## 1. `pkgs.py`

This Python script fetches and installs packages from a remote site.

### Key Features:
- Fetches package information from a JSON file hosted online
- Allows listing available packages
- Installs selected packages using `pacman` or `yay`

### Notable Functions:
- `fetch_packages()`: Retrieves package data from the remote URL
- `display_packages(packages)`: Shows available packages grouped by category
- `install_packages(packages, selected_packages)`: Installs user-selected packages

### Usage:

```bash
python pkgs.py --list  # List available packages
python pkgs.py --install pkg1,pkg2,pkg3  # Install specific packages
```

## 2. `pkgs.json`

This JSON file contains the package definitions used by `pkgs.py`.

### Structure:
```json
{
  "package_id": {
    "name": "Package Name",
    "description": "Package description",
    "install": "Installation command",
    "category": "Package category"
  },
  ...
}
```
