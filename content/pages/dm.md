Greetings, mortal souls who dare to seek communion with the Dark One... You wish to send a message into the abyss? Very well, but heed these unholy commandments, lest you incur my wrath.

**YES!** Even I, Harbinger of Shadows, have rules for this infernal communication.

It vexes me greatly when a pitiful mortal sends a mere "Hello!" into the void, only to vanish for eons! To avoid eternal damnation, follow these demonic guidelines:

You may summon me through the portals of [Discord](/links/discord) or [Twitter](/links/twitter).

### **THOU SHALT NOT** send these accursed messages:
- "Hello, are you lurking in the shadows?" <And naught else>
- "Greetings, Dark One, I seek knowledge..." <Without further elaboration>
- "Do you have a moment to spare, O Corrupted One?" <Lacking details>
- "Hail, Stella" <With no unholy purpose>
- "May I inquire about the dark arts?" <Speak, fool!>

### **Instead, embrace the darkness and do this:**
- Plunge into the depths of your query! I crave direct incantations such as:
  - "O Stella, I seek guidance on summoning X in my arcane project. What forbidden knowledge can you impart?"
  - "Dark inquiry: How dost thou navigate the treacherous waters of Y? I am ensnared by this conundrum."
  - "I require thy infernal wisdom regarding Z. Behold the nature of my torment..."
  
Thus, I may corrupt your soul swiftly, avoiding the tedious dance of "art thou present?"

### Actions that shall please the Dark One:
- If you value your mortal existence and speak with unholy haste.
- If you offer sufficient eldritch details for me to weave my dark magic.
- If you do not leave me waiting in the void for eons after I have graced you with a response!

### Additional Demonic Counsel:
- Be mindful of the witching hour! I may not always emerge from the shadows immediately.
- If thy question can be answered by consulting the all-seeing eye of Google, do so before summoning me.
