## What is VTubersTV? 

VTubersTV is a project that I have been working on for around a year and a half (as of 2024/11/5).
The goal is simple. **Make an all in one place for VTubers**

## Key Features

VTubersTV aims to be the next generation VTuber platform, offering:

- Content creation tools
- Community integration features
- Analytics for creators
- Streaming support
- Comprehensive resource hub

## The Mission

I believe it is crucial to have a competitive platform that is transparent, open source, and knows what VTubers are and how they operate. VTubersTV isn't just another video platform - it's built specifically with VTubers in mind, understanding their unique needs and community dynamics.

## Open Source Philosophy

VTubersTV is proudly open source, which means:

- All the code is publicly available for use, modification, and distribution
- Development happens transparently through collaboration
- The platform is and will always remain free to use
- Community members can directly contribute to the platform's growth
- Security and privacy measures can be independently verified

You can find all of the code repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vtuberstv), where I welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Why Open Source Matters

For a platform dedicated to VTubers, being open source is particularly important because:

- It ensures transparency in how creator data is handled
- Allows the community to help shape the platform's future
- Provides security through code visibility
- Enables faster feature development and bug fixes
- Creates trust between the platform and its users

## Launch Details

The platform is scheduled for launch on November 26, 2024. I'm building this with and for the VTuber community, ensuring it meets the needs of both creators and their audiences.

## Get Involved

There are several ways to get involved with the project:

- Join the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/KtaNFKjFKQ)
- Follow on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/vtubers.tv)
- Contribute to the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Vtuberstv)

## Team

The project is being developed by a dedicated team including:

- Stella (Choco) - Founder & Lead Developer
- Lmay - Administrator
- Valoix - Moderator
- Kami - Support Specialist

I'm excited to bring this platform to the VTuber community and continue building features that empower creators and their audiences.

## Why haven't I heard about this before?

Honestly, I haven't really done any marketing for it, because I have really really bad social anxiety and I'm not good at talking to people.

I'm hoping that by open sourcing it, more people will join and help with the development.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/KtaNFKjFKQ).
