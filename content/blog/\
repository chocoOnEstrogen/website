If you didn't know, I have been using VSCode (Visual Studio Code) for a *long time*, I have always liked it because of it's 
simplicity and the fact that it's open source. When GitHub Copilot was released, I enjoyed it even more. 

About 3 months ago, I discovered Cursor, a new code editor that was gaining popularity. I decided to give it a try and I was
impressed by the fact it had a GitHub Copilot-like feature built-in. I decided to switch to Cursor and I've been using it since.

However, since switching back to Arch Linux and Hyprland, I've been looking for a more lightweight code editor. So I tried Vim,
and I liked it. Then I remembered that NeoVim was a thing, so I decided to give it a try. I've been using it for a week now and I love it. I used [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/?utm_source=choco.rip&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=cursor-to-neovim) to set it up and it's been great.

I have configured it to look like my Everforest Desktop theme and I have installed some plugins like [`presence.nvim`](https://github.com/andweeb/presence.nvim).

Here is a small look at my `Nvdash`:
