Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to ask for your support with donations. We need to raise **$400** to set up proper servers for VTubersTV. Below is an outline of our planned server infrastructure and why it's essential for the project.

## Server Infrastructure

### Backend Server
This server will host the primary platform, including both the [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) and [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend). It will serve as the backbone of VTubersTV, handling user interactions and core functionalities.

### Database Server
The Database Server will run a local instance of [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), ensuring the database remains on our network rather than in the cloud. This setup allows for faster connection times and enhanced control over our data.

### Microservices Server
This server is crucial for running [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) and performing [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) tasks. These capabilities are essential for advanced features we plan to offer.

### Caching Server
A dedicated [caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) server will enable us to store frequently used data on disk, reducing the load on other servers and improving performance.

## Why This is Important
Hosting our infrastructure in-house is vital. I prefer not to rely on cloud services or virtual private servers (VPS), as owning the hardware gives us greater autonomy and ensures optimal performance.

## Commitment to Open Source
VTubersTV is designed to be a **non-profit, open-source project**, and it will remain that way. Any revenue from donations or future premium features will go directly back into supporting the project. I, Stella, will not personally profit from VTubersTV. My goal is to create something valuable for the community, powered by the community.

## How You Can Help
Your donations will directly fund the server infrastructure needed to launch VTubersTV. If you can’t donate, please consider sharing this message to help spread the word.
