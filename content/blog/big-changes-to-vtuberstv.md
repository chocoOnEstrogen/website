Currently, VTubersTV is a simple project with no internal structure. This is about to change.

If you didn’t know, VTubersTV is just a project, not a company or an organization. It’s something I’ve been working on independently, driven by passion and community engagement.

That said, growth comes with new challenges. To ensure the long-term sustainability of VTubersTV while keeping it open source, we’re introducing some significant changes to its structure.

## What’s Changing?

1. A Clearer Project Framework: 

VTubersTV will adopt an internal structure similar to what you’d expect from an organization—but *without becoming a company*. This means adding roles like a CEO, Trust and Safety team, and other essential positions to guide the project and make sure it runs smoothly.

By doing this, we’ll create a more professional framework to support the project’s growth and meet the needs of its users, all while staying true to the open-source ethos.

2. Dedicated Job Opportunities:

To help build this new structure, VTubersTV now has a jobs website: [https://jobs.vtubers.tv](https://jobs.vtubers.tv). Here, you can find opportunities to join the team, contribute to the project, and help shape the future of VTubersTV. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or just a fan of the community, there may be a spot for you.


3. Commitment to Open Source:

One thing that isn’t changing is our commitment to remaining open source. VTubersTV will continue to be a platform that values transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development.

## What’s Next?

Although VTubersTV hasn’t officially launched yet, these changes set the stage for an exciting future. We’re laying the groundwork now to ensure that when the project does release, it will be prepared to grow responsibly and thrive as an open-source initiative.
