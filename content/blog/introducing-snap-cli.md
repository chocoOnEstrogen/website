## What is Snap CLI?

Snap CLI is a tool I developed to make Git workflows more efficient and intuitive. As someone who works with Git daily, I noticed several pain points in the standard Git workflow that could be improved. That's where Snap comes in.

### Key Features

- **Smart Commit Management**: Intelligently handles commit organization and structuring
- **Branch Operations**: Simplified branch management and switching
- **Configuration Management**: Easy-to-use config system for customizing your workflow
- **Web Interface**: A clean, modern interface for visual Git management
- **Enhanced Status Display**: Clear, concise status information at a glance

## Why I Built It

As a developer working on multiple projects like VTubersTV, I needed a tool that could streamline my Git workflow without sacrificing power or flexibility. Snap CLI is the result of addressing these needs while maintaining an intuitive interface.

## Getting Started
