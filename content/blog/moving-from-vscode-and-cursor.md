For a long time, Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was my go-to editor. Its simplicity, open-source nature, and versatility made it a natural choice. When GitHub Copilot launched, it elevated my coding experience even further, providing intelligent suggestions and speeding up my workflow.  

About three months ago, I stumbled upon **Cursor**, a new code editor gaining traction for its built-in AI-assisted coding features, similar to Copilot. Intrigued, I gave it a try and quickly switched to it. Cursor worked great, and I’ve enjoyed using it.  

However, things started to change when I moved back to **Arch Linux** with the **Hyprland** window manager. As much as I appreciated Cursor’s capabilities, I craved a lighter, faster editor that better aligned with my minimalist setup. That’s when I decided to explore **Vim**.  

### Discovering NeoVim  

Vim’s legendary efficiency drew me in, but then I remembered hearing about **NeoVim**, an improved, modernized fork of Vim. I decided to give it a shot, and after a week of use, I can confidently say: **I’m hooked.**  

To kickstart my NeoVim journey, I used [**NVChad**](https://nvchad.com/?utm_source=choco.rip&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=cursor-to-neovim), a pre-configured Neovim setup that made the transition smooth and enjoyable. The flexibility to customize everything exactly to my liking was a game-changer.  

### My NeoVim Setup  

I’ve tailored NeoVim to fit the aesthetic of my **Everforest desktop theme**, and added a few plugins that enhance my workflow. One standout plugin is [`presence.nvim`](https://github.com/andweeb/presence.nvim), which integrates NeoVim with Discord, showcasing my activity as I code.  

If you’re curious about my full configuration, check out my [**dotfiles**](/projects/dotfiles) page, where I’ve shared everything.  

### Why NeoVim?  

Switching to NeoVim has been refreshing. It’s lightweight, blazingly fast, and works seamlessly in my Arch + Hyprland environment. The rich ecosystem of plugins and the freedom to tweak every aspect of the editor make it a joy to use.  

While I’ll always appreciate VSCode and Cursor for what they offered, NeoVim feels like home now. If you’re considering a switch or just curious, give it a try—you might be surprised at what you’ve been missing.
